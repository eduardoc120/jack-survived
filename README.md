# jack-survived

This program was written in C++ and it gets data from a file and stores it in a dynamically allocated array, sorts the information, and then looks at the data and analyzes the data in the form of a summary.

You must introduce the name of the file with the data to the program and it will still ask for the filename until it gets a valid one.

You have a test data file with the name **`input.dat.`**
